All PyTorch tensors also have a `device` attribute that specifies the device where the tensor is stored -- either CPU, or CUDA (for NVIDA GPUs). A tensor on a CUDA device will automatically use that device to accelerate all of its operations.\n","\n","Just as with datatypes, we can use the [`.to()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.1.0/tensors.html#torch.Tensor.to) method to change the device of a tensor. We can also use the convenience methods `.cuda()` and `.cpu()` methods to move tensors between CPU and GPU."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":16,"metadata":{"id":"D03s614dMCvy","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1741069576980,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":38,"user":{"displayName":"GaGyeom Kim","userId":"07719571943439998480"}},"outputId":"2be52629-548a-450c-9bb6-2c02bcc39f21"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["x0 device: cpu\n","x1 device: cuda:0\n","x2 device: cuda:0\n","x3 device: cpu\n","x4 device: cpu\n","y device / dtype: cuda:0 torch.float64\n","x5 device / dtype: cuda:0 torch.float64\n"]}],"source":["# Construct a tensor on the CPU\n","x0 = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]], dtype=torch.float32)\n","print('x0 device:', x0.device)\n","\n","# Move it to the GPU using .to()\n","x1 = x0.to('cuda')\n","print('x1 device:', x1.device)\n","\n","# Move it to the GPU using .cuda()\n","x2 = x0.cuda()\n","print('x2 device:', x2.device)\n","\n","# Move it back to the CPU using .to()\n","x3 = x1.to('cpu')\n","print('x3 device:', x3.device)\n","\n","# Move it back to the CPU using .cpu()\n","x4 = x2.cpu()\n","print('x4 device:', x4.device)\n","\n","# We can construct tensors directly on the GPU as well\n","y = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], dtype=torch.float64, device='cuda')\n","print('y device / dtype:', y.device, y.dtype)\n","\n","# Calling x.to(y) where y is a tensor will return a copy of x with the same\n","# device and dtype as y\n","x5 = x0.to(y)\n","print('x5 device / dtype:', x5.device, x5.dtype)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"O-TDxICdOmJo"},"source":["Performing large tensor operations on a GPU can be **a lot faster** than running the equivalent operation on CPU.\n","\n","Here we compare the speed of adding two tensors of shape (10000, 10000) on CPU and GPU:\n","\n","(Note that GPU code may run asynchronously with CPU code, so when timing the speed of operations on the GPU it is important to use `torch.cuda.synchronize` to synchronize the CPU and GPU.)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":17,"metadata":{"id":"GW14ZF-_PK7t","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1741069585478,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":3807,"user":{"displayName":"GaGyeom Kim","userId":"07719571943439998480"}},"outputId":"216282fd-862e-49fc-8f12-f376b1444427"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Max difference between c_gpu and c_cpu: 0.0\n","CPU time: 337.44 ms\n","GPU time: 5.11 ms\n","GPU speedup: 66.04 x\n"]}],"source":["import time\n","\n","a_cpu = torch.randn(10000, 10000, dtype=torch.float32)\n","b_cpu = torch.randn(10000, 10000, dtype=torch.float32)\n","\n","a_gpu = a_cpu.cuda()\n","b_gpu = b_cpu.cuda()\n","torch.cuda.synchronize()\n","\n","t0 = time.time()\n","c_cpu = a_cpu + b_cpu\n","t1 = time.time()\n","c_gpu = a_gpu + b_gpu\n","torch.cuda.synchronize()\n","t2 = time.time()\n","\n","# Check that they computed the same thing\n","diff = (c_gpu.cpu() - c_cpu).abs().max().item()\n","print('Max difference between c_gpu and c_cpu:', diff)\n","\n","cpu_time = 1000.0 * (t1 - t0)\n","gpu_time = 1000.0 * (t2 - t1)\n","print('CPU time: %.2f ms' % cpu_time)\n","print('GPU time: %.2f ms' % gpu_time)\n","print('GPU speedup: %.2f x' % (cpu_time / gpu_time))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7HEAVPEwviYb"},"source":["You should see that running the same computation on the GPU was more than 10~30 times faster than on the CPU!
